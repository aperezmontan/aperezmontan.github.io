  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h3>Request Fatigue</h3>
  <h5>March 29, 2015</h5>
  <p>An ex girlfriend of mine used to give me "Request Fatigue".  Don't know what that is?  It's when someone asks you for so many things in a short amount of time that it literally has a fatiguing affect on you.  Obviously this is not a medical fact nor have I done any research into the condition but it's the best way I can describe what she used to do to me. To give you an example, say her and I were in the middle of watching a show.  Her requests would go something like this (I have listed the times to give you an idea of the frequency of her requests):</p>
  <ul><small>
    <li>  10:30: Could you get me some ice cream from the fridge?
    <li>  10:31: (after going to the kitchen and bringing her the ice cream) Since you're up could you get me my iPad from the other room?
    <li>  10:32: (while on my way back from getting her iPad) Did you take out the trash ? Something stinks.
    <li>  10:35: (after taking out the trash and right before attempting to sit back down) Oh, sorry, could you turn off the kitchen light, it's way too bright. Hurry up, the show's starting !
    <li>  10:36: (after sitting down and exhaling in relief) I'm sorry babe but could you get me the other ice cream, I don't like this flavor...
  </small></ul>
  <p>Man this would PISS ME OFF !  I felt like she was taking me for granted.  Like I was her little servant that she could ask to do anything and she knew I would do it.  It was like she wasn't taking my feelings into account, almost like it was all about her and it didn't matter how I felt. I don't know, I just feel like asking for things in that way is inconsiderate of the other person.  Like they're beneath you in a way.  Or maybe this is how all relationships are?</p>
  <p>At first I would tell her it pissed me off when she asked for things like that and we would end up fighting.  I realized later that me telling her that what she was doing "pissed me off" wasn't going to help the matter.  I needed to be specific and tell her how it made me feel.  I told her that I felt she was being inconsiderate by requesting things from me in such rapid fire fashion.  It was dehumanizing; that I felt less like her boyfriend and more like a servant.  She responded saying that she didn't realize that that's what she was doing.  To her at the time the requests just made sense and I could've said no or provided an alternative if I didn't want to do it at the time.  Also, some of her requests (like taking out the trash) were more like statements, not requests, in that she didn't specifically ask me to take out the trash, she was just noting that it smelled bad.  I didn't realize that, but, whether it was because it was in the middle of a "request stream" (another non-medical term made up by yours truly) or because I was trying to do my best to be a good boyfriend, I was carrying out tasks that she never explicitly requested.  She was just making a note.</p>
  <p>After that she would still give me request fatigue from time to time but it was much less frequent and she did notice it more.  I think we handled it as best we could and both learned to be more in tune with the other person's intentions.  But we broke up so it was probably a waste of time anyways...</p>
  <p>JUST KIDDING !!  One more week till onsite !<p>

        <h1>Phase 0, Week 8</h1>
        <h4>Issues in Tech: Cryptography, Cyber Security and Quantum Computing</h4>
        <h5>March 29, 2015</h5>
          <p>Security is important.  I think almost everyone wants to feel secure, to feel like their private things stay private.  This is especially true on the web where, likely, most people don't really know what happens to their private information once it gets punched into a computer and the send/submit/place order button is pressed.  For the most part we have faith in the Googles/Bank of Americas/Amazons out there; that they will keep our information secure.  If you feel this way, this entry might be encouraging or troubling.  Either way, I hope to shed a little light on what actually happens when you send your private information over the web.</p>
          <p>The way our "classical computers" (more on this in a later) keep our information secure is through encryption keys.  Using assymetric key encryption (where one key is public and one is private) people can send me information with the public key.  However, only I have the private key so only I can read the messages that are sent.  Let me qualify "only": I say "only" because, if an attacker wants to do enough decrypting work, they could potentially figure out my private key.  However, the amount of work required is so daunting that, on human time scales, I'm realistically the only one that has access the information.  This is because the public key is the product of prime numbers.  Finding the prime factors of a large number is exceedingly difficult for computers and almost impossible for humans.</p>
          <p>To give you an even simpler, more concrete example, think of your email address as a number that is the product of 2 primes: 9973 and 839.  The product, 8367347, is your email address.  You can publish 8367347 to the world and tell everyone to send you information to that address.  However, getting to that information in your mailbox requires you to factor 8367347 into it's component prime numbers, 9973 and 839.  Like I said above, factoring large numbers is tough (try it! try factoring 899 into it's primes.  The answer is at the end of this entry).  Conversely however, if you know one of these numbers, the answer is trivial, since you would just divide 8367347 by one of these numbers to get the other.</p>
          <p>Now, I said above that factoring a large number into its component primes is difficult for computers but it's not that difficult when the number is (relatively) small.  8367347 is small to a computer because a computer is capable of billions of computations or "trys" per second, so it could factor this number rather quickly.  But the keys we use in real life are significantly larger.  Ever heard of 64-bit encryption?  Think of each bit as a prime number and the key is the product of all these primes.  That number is in the quadrillions !!  When the number gets this big, as powerful as computers are, it takes decades of time to decipher these keys and becomes essentially impossible for humans.  That is, until viable quantum computers are created.</p>
          <p>Quantum computers have qubits instead of bits and, what makes them special and at the same time very difficult to understand, is that they can take on multiple values at the same time.  In "classical" computing, the computer has to try a value, see if it's correct, and, if not, try another value over and over again.  Quantum computers don't have this limitation.  Their qubits can simultaneously be any range of numbers, meaning that it can instantaneously calculate the 2 prime factors of any number with just 2 qubits.  128-bit encryption would be trivial to a quantum computer, factoring a number that would take a classical computer decades in a matter of seconds.</p>
          <p>Not to worry, however.  This problem is well-known and lots of research is going into new, more powerful encryption algorithms (noisy linear systems, lattice systems, etc.) that are difficult for all computers, quantum or not, to solve.  I think the importance of these techniques is intuitive for almost anyone.  When Target has the private information of all its debit card users compromised, that hits home.  Even if you haven't shopped at Target, it's natural to ask yourself "can other retailers that I've shopped at be subject to this kind of attack?"  While the attack that Target experienced is not the same thing that's discussed in this article, the lesson is well-received.  All forms of security can be compromised because we're human; security on the web is of the utmost importance; and we must continue to be vigilant and research to ensure we feel safe on this still new, virtual world.</p>

  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h3>Poise</h3>
  <h5>March 25, 2015</h5>
  <p>One of the values that I most admire is poise.  I know it may seem boring but it's something that I will try all my life to try to perfect, with varying degrees of success.  I admire poise because I think that's what a true leader exudes without trying.  From Winston Churchill to Derek Jeter, those men and women in history who seemed unflappable in this face of the greatest obstacles, they are my role models.  I think there's a lot to be said for a person who can stay focused when they get a bad break, someone who remains calm when getting some horrible news, a leader who calms his troops after a recent victory.  These individuals may seem boring, but to me they are the glue to an otherwise volatile society.  If the stock market is any indicator, we humans are an emotional lot.  We bask in emotion, in our ups and downs, and I believe it is the few who don't buckle under the pressure, who end up leading us forward.</p>
  <p>I've been described this way before.  Even though I feel like I can improve, I take a lot of pride being described as "even-keeled" or "cool under pressure".  I have my mother to credit for this.  I remember vividly one day at the swimming pool in our apartment complex in Virginia.  I had begged my mother to let me jump into the deep end of the pool, assuring her that I knew how to swim, that I wouldn't need any help.  At least I thought I didn't.  She relented and off I went, my legs pushed up against my chest and my arms wrapped around them as I lept, executing a textbook cannonball into the deep end of the pool.  And for a while, it was good.</p>
  <p>The moment was short-lived, however, as I quickly realized my self-professed aquatic acumen left much to be desired.  I was flapping my arms wildly (and ironically) like a fish out of water.  It was useless.  I ripped and clawed for the surface.  I gasped for air but I must've been thirsty because I had more than enough pool water to drink that day.  Every now and then, when I momentarily could get my head above the water, I noticed my mother coming towards me at a leisurely pace, unfazed, like nothing at all was wrong.  I could've sworn I saw my life flash before my eyes 3 times before she pulled me out of the water.  She didn't scold me, she asked me if I was ok.  I assured her I was and I went back to our spot poolside to get some air back in my lungs and to relax... for a bit.</p>
  <p>Almost like it never happened, I scurried over to the deep end and jumped in.  I had it this time !!</p>
  <p>No I didn't.  I was drowning again.  I was flailing my arms everywhere, gasping for air to no avail.  I tested fate twice and this time my mother wasn't coming for me.  I had been splashing and screaming for help for what felt like an eternity and my mother still wasn't here to help me.  I figured this was it, this was the end.  I was wrong.  My mom took a little longer, ensuring I downed a few more gulps of pool water this time, but she got me out.  No scolding, barely any words at all.  She just let me sit on the side and rest while she continued reading her magazine.  The pervading thought in my head was "why can't I get this?  Why can't I swim?  I thought I had it.  Didn't I?  Yes I did, I was sure of it !"</p>
  <p>I jumped back in...</p>
  <p>At this point I think the story becomes more believable if I told you that I stretched my arms out wide and pushed down hard and fast with my hands and feet and started doggy-paddling.  Nope, that's not what happened at all.  I was drowning again, and again, my mother, unperturbed, pulled me out of the pool.</p>
  <p>This time, the lifeguard came up to us and said "I'm sorry, ma'am, but you and your son are going to have to leave.  I can't watch the entire pool when your son is drowning every 5 minutes !"  So we left.  My mother never chastised me, she never punished me for my intolerable behavior.  We just picked up our stuff and we left.</p>
  <p>She was telling that story to a group of family and friends recently and someone asked her, "Please tell us, why on Earth did you let him keep jumping into the pool?!  And how could you be so calm about it??!" to which she replied,</p>
  <p>"I didn't want him to be afraid.</p>
  <p>"I was terrified at what was happening to him, but I knew if I ran up to him panicked and screaming his name that he may grow up forever being afraid of the water.  Kids look to you as their leader, their rock, and however you react to a situation, they're going to feel the exact same way."  She was 100% right.  I was afraid when I couldn't figure out how to come up out of the water for air, but to see her calmly pull me out told me instantly "there's nothing to be afraid of". It emboldened me.  It made me try harder to learn how to swim.  Focus in the face of adversity; resolve when things don't go your way; courage when you're afraid.  These are examples of poise, a value that I was taught when I was quite young, and that I'll never forget.</p>

      <h1>Phase 0, Week 7</h1>
      <h4>JavaScript</h4>
      <h5>March 25, 2015</h5>
        <p>This week we've started learning JavaScript.  I'll freely admit, I'd never heard of Ruby before I started DBC.  Learning it was great, Ruby is so useful and I've really enjoyed learning how to make my own programs with it.  That said, learning JavaScript is very exciting.  JavaScript is called "the language of the web".  Given it's prominence, finally learning it this week has really solidified the fact that we are working to become true web developers !!</p>
        <p>That said, JavaScript is SOOOOO much harder to use than Ruby.  Granted, we've only been working in JavaScript for a week but I've already experienced countless times where Ruby's intuitive methods and syntax make it far superior to implement than JavaScript.  I've caught myself saying "God, this would be so much easier in Ruby !!" more than once.</p>
        <p>A particularly annoying example is sorting an array of numbers in Ruby versus JavaScript.  Let's say we have this array of numbers: b = [7,16,3,4,29,45,28].  Using the syntax "b.sort" in Ruby would produce this:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">b.sort >> [3,4,7,16,28,29,45]</pre>

        Great, that's exactly what we expected.  Using "b.sort()" in JavaScript, however, produces this:

          <pre class="brush: JavaScript;">b.sort() >> [16,28,29,3,4,45,7]</pre>

        Why, o JavaScript, why ??  So it seems that JavaScript turns the elements in the array into strings before sorting and, because 1 comes before 2, it doesn't matter if it's 1 or 10000, it will always come before 2.  Joy -__- </p>
        <p>This issue is easily remedied using the compare() function.

          <pre class="brush: JavaScript;">b.sort(function(a, b){return a-b}) >> [3,4,7,16,28,29,45]</pre>

        This function compares each element in its true number form and sorts the array properly based on how you orient the a and b.  a - b will sort the numbers from smallest to largest.  b - a will do the reverse.  Such is life... I guess.</p>
        <p>On site is less than 2 weeks away !  CAN'T WAIT !!</p>

  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h5>March 15, 2015</h5>
  <p>I find this blog entry quite personal and particularly impactful in my life. I'll use this medium to somewhat purge myself of some feelings I've had for a long time now that, thankfully, I feel I may have found some answers to through research on this topic. I'll begin with a definition:</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat"><em>Stereotype Threat</em></a> is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group <small><i>- Wikipedia</i></small></font></p>
  <p>Dr. Claude Steele of Columbia University, is one of the leading researchers in this field. He explains that one of the first studies he performed was comparing the SAT scores of prospective students with their eventual performance at the university (coincidentally, the "university" here was the University of Michigan, where I graduated). He noticed that, intuitively, the higher a student scored on the SAT the better they performed while at the university. He noticed, however, while comparing white and black students, although they both showed the same correlation of better performance for better SATs, the performance of black students at the university was lower than for whites with the same SAT score. For example, a white student with a 1200 SAT score might become a B student at the university while a black student with a 1200 SAT score ended up becoming a C student. </p>
  <p>I wanted to give this context because I didn't do well at Michigan. I barely passed. It took me 4 and a half years to graduate and I was barely a C student. This is hard to write and I am somewhat embarrassed about putting it out there for all the world (including my potential future employers) to see... But I always wondered why? All my life I had been at the top of my class. My parents didn't have much money but they spent every spare dime they could to give me a world class education. I always went to private school, had mandatory reading lists and schoolwork (from my mom, who would eventually achieve her dream of becoming a schoolteacher. I like to tell people she practiced on me first :), countless tutors and the like. ANYTHING that would further my education, if my mom could make it happen, I was enrolled, signed up or scheduled.</p>
  <p>The hard work paid off, and I was accepted into the elite Stuyvesant High School in New York City. Here is where I think I had my first experience with Steretype Threat.  The demographics at Stuyvesant hit you like a ton of bricks when all the other schools you've ever been to were mostly white.  Everyone is Asian.  Not everyone, obviously, but I think the demographics were something like 65% from East Asia (including the Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, areas), 30% white and the remaining 5% black and hispanic.  There were so few black and hispanic minorities that in a school with over 3000 students I honestly think I was friends with all of them.  Quite a shock.  I didn't do poorly overall at Stuyvesant but I did initially. I was finding it hard to adapt to this new environment but eventually I got used to it and got As and Bs.  Not bad, but far from the straight A student I had been just a few years prior.</p>
  <p>Michigan was like a dream come true, that very quickly turned into a nightmare.  I worked hard my first term and ended up with Bs and Cs.  I was an engineering student so my classes were pretty rigorous and I assured my parents that I would do better.  I didn't.  With each successive term my grades got worse and worse until I was finally put on academic probabtion.  I stopped trying.  I never knew why.  The classes were hard, but they weren't impossible.  I learned a lot, even with the little work that I put in, but of course it wasn't enough.  I ended up changing majors, my dream of becoming an electrical engineer gone forever.  I was a bit upset about that but I remember thinking that not too many people like me even get this far.  I can still graduate with a degree from the University of Michigan!  Even if I barely make it, isn't that enough?</p>
  <p>I did slightly better in my last couple of years, but just enough to pass.  I never really tried as hard as I could.  I never really liked it at Michigan.  I felt like I was being looked at constantly and the stigma only emboldened me to further ostrocize myself.  Affirmative action was a hot topic at the time too. The supreme court decided that the affirmative action policies at Michigan were unconstitutional, making me feel even more like I didn't belong there.</p>
  <p><i>I wasn't good enough to be there... I keep getting bad grades... I'm a bad kid... I should just give up already.... GO HOME</i></p>
  <p>This is my Stereotype Threat story.</p>

  <h1>Phase 0, Week 6</h1>
  <h4>Object-Oriented vs Functional Programming</h4>
  <h5>March 15, 2015</h5>
    <p>Ruby, like many of the most popular programming languages out there, is an Object-Oriented language.  What this means is that any program is basically a collection of objects that are manipulated (and can manipulate each other) in such a way that a desired outcome is produced.  We can create all kinds of objects: classes, strings, arrays, hashes, etc. and we can do all kinds of things to these objects using methods, which can in turn involve other objects or methods.  These objects are named with variables which can be changed over and over again without issue.</p>
    <p>Functional Programming is very different.  It's very math based in that programs are made up of a series of functions which cannot be changed; this is known as being "immutable".  An example might be if you'd like to change the contents of an array.  Instead of just assigning new values to the array, you'd have to make a completely different array.  Also, functions have no memory in functional programming. This is known as being "stateless" and it means that they perform in exactly the same way each time they're run, with previous runs having no affect on future runs.  This is very different from object-oriented programming where methods and variables can change, and do change, all the time!</p>
    <p>Functional programming is some pretty advanced stuff but, as inflexible as it seems, it's very useful in situations where reliability is of the utmost importance.  Well, that begs the question, isn't reliability always important?  Yes, that's true but for this application it's important to take the context into account.  If your "Subway Surfers" game errors out and restarts when you are on the verge of a new high score, that would really suck, but would it be life changing?  I argue that life would go on.  However, if NASA needed a rocket to pinpoint the exact coordinates of an asteroid headed on a collision course with Earth and the code it uses must perform consistently and reliably every time, functional programming might be the the best way to go, don't you think?</p>
    <p>You know what?  I'm gonna look into this whole Functional Programming stuff a little more, sounds like there's a future in it !!

  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
  <h5>March 8, 2015</h5>
  <p>For this post we were asked to talk about giving and receiving feedback from our peers in DBC.  DBC requires we pair at least 3 times a week with someone in our cohort, puts a HUGE emphasis on feedback and encourages us to take it very seriously.  Since being at DBC, I've paired and given/received feedback over a dozen times at this point.  Here are some of the things I've noticed since I began. </p>
  <p>Pairing with someone you've never met can be pretty nerve racking.  I gotten used to it very quickly, however, and since we're always working on a challenge, to me, there's a direction for the conversation so long as you're both working to solve the problem.  Each encounter has been very smooth.</p>
  <p>All of my pairs have put 100% effort into solving the challenges we've worked on.  To that end I've found that many of them have gone out searching for different tips, tricks, plugins, etc. on their own that have made solving the problems, as well as using the different programs we need (sublime, terminal, github, etc.), so much easier.  Many of them post the help on our Google+ hangout so there's definitely a sense of team and "one for all" that permeates throughout the cohort which is really refreshing.</p>
  <p>One thing that can be frustrating about the pairing sessions is when someone you're working with doesn't strictly adhere to their "driver" and "navigator" roles.  In general a driver does the typing and the navigator does the talking.  It gets confusing for me because if the driver goes off on their own to search for a solution to a problem. I end up kind of feeling alone, like I'm not doing anything to contribute to the group.  Because of this, I go a little nuts (admittedly) about really defining the driver and navigator roles before we get into solving the challenge.  This way there's no confusion and I can also make it evident to my pair how important it is to stick to our roles.</p>
  <p>After we pair, we're required to give feedback on the session.  Reading your feedback can be a shocking experience to say the least.  I definitely learned some things that I may not have realized I had been doing during my session.  At first, I had a "get out of here" reaction.  I was incredulous.  But now that I've received similar feedback a few times, I think there are some things that I need to be a bit more cognizant of in my future pairing sessions.  For instance, sometimes I think I stay in my own head when trying to solve a problem instead of talking it out.  Some pairs have mentioned that talking it out and including them in my thought process could help us both solve the problem much easier.  I didn't even realize I was doing that !!</p>
  <p>Leaving feedback is the other side of the coin.  They encourage us to start out with something nice to say about our partner.  Then, give some sort of critique that they can improve on in the future.  Always make sure that your feedback is Specific, Actionable and Kind.  Being kind is easy, all of my pairs have been great, considerate and 100% devoted to solving the challenge.  Giving specific and actionable feedback though, not so much.  There are times that I feel that there's nothing my pair could've done better.  What do I say then?  I typically just say "keep doing what you're doing", but then my feedback gets rated (yep, our feedback gets anonomously rated by other DBCers) poorly.  UGH!
  <p>Overall I think the pairing and feedback process at DBC is great.  It has DEFINITELY accelerated the learning process for me while also familiarizing me with the typical work environment for a developer.  I honestly look forward to improving my pairing skills with the feedback I've been given because I know this is a skill that's required and probably not as well developed for most people looking to get jobs as developers.  Also, it has made me a more social person.  I'm an introvert by nature and I'm starting to realize that as a developer this isn't very helpful when working with others on a project.  Being forced to talk to people you don't know is one way of becoming more of an extrovert, and DBC demands, at least 3 times a week lol</p>
  <p>BRING ON WEEK 6 !!</p>

        <h1>Phase 0, Week 5</h1>
        <h4>Classes</h4>
        <h5>March 8, 2015</h5>
          <p>Classes.  These things are powerful.  I know it.  I know it because I've seen them.  I've seen them when I've looked at the source code of the various web sites and apps that made me wonder "wow, how'd they do that?!"  They really hit us hard with Classes this week, and I still don't know if I've got them 100%, but I'll try to explain them in a way that most people can understand.</p>
          <p>You can think of Classes like any object that in general is the same but can have different models or characteristics.  The example we will use is a car.</p>
          <p>All cars have general, necessary characteristics.  They all have engines/motors, wheels, seats, etc.  However, we all know that they can be very different.  Some engines are much bigger or smaller than others and they can be internal combustion or eletric.  They can have different size wheels or different numbers of seats.  But whether you have a compact car or a minivan, all cars fall into a general category: Cars.</p>
          <p>So let's say we want to define a class called cars and give it a few characteristics like engine and wheels.  You can do that with the following syntax:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">class Car</pre>

          We're going to initialize the engine to be a V6.  The "initialize" method is unique to classes, giving us something to start with in every new instance of a class.

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  def initialize</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">    @engine = "V6"</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  end</pre>

          So we've defined the "characteristic" of engine as V6 to start.  Other "characteristics" can be defined using methods and variables:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  def wheels(sizeOfWheels)</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">    if sizeOfWheels > 20</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">      @engine = "V8"</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">    end</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  end</pre>

          We also need a way to call the @engine variable.  To do this we create a method that only includes the @engine variable:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  def engine</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">    @engine</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">  end</pre>

          Finally we need to end the class definition:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">end</pre>

          As you can see from the example above, there seems to be a lot going on here.  It's not really that complicated.  First, you might've noticed, variables and methods can have the same name (in the "engine" method).  The method "engine" is an instance method.  This means that every new version of "Car" will have a method attached to it called "engine" that has been initialized to "V6" (from the "initialize" method further above). This is also something that is unique to classes.  You might've also noticed there's an "@" symbol before the "engine" variable.  This is an example of an instance variable and it means it can be used by every method in the class.  For example, the "wheels" method is changing the value of @engine if it satisfies a certain condition, namely, if the number "sizeOfWheels" is bigger than 20.</p>

          <p>Obviously the "wheels" method differs from the "engine" method because a value can actually be passed to it.  Also, the variable "sizeOfWheels" is only accessible in the "wheels" method because there is no @ in front of it.</p>

          We can now create a new instance of this class like so:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">truck = Car.new</pre>

          We've now created a new Car class called "truck".  If we were to print our "engine" method containing the type of our engine, we would get:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">p truck.engine</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">>>"V6"</pre>

          Our truck has 24 inch rims, though, so let's pass that value into the "wheels" method:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">truck.wheels(24)</pre>

          Because of this, let's check what our engine method returns now:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">p truck.engine</pre>
          <pre class="brush: ruby;">>>"V8"</pre>

          Cool huh?!  Now we can make all different kids of cars with all kinds of different "characteristics" (methods) that can communicate with each other with instance variables.  Sweet !!

  <h1>Issues in Tech</h1>
  <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
  <h5>March 1, 2015</h5>
  <p>So I've taken a huge interest in Machine Learning recently.  Some might call it an obsession lol.  Interestingly, a lot of the essential pre reqs needed to understand Machine Learning at a deep level are all classes I took in college.  So I've been on Khan Academy and MIT open courseware getting refreshers on Linear Algebra, Calculus and Stats.  Not like I need any more work to go along with DBC but it doesn't really feel like work.  Yea, I'm a nerd lol</p>
  <p>Machine Learning is a problem in tech right now for a few reasons.</p>
  <p>We know it can be really useful based on its current implementations.  From google searches to the computers in your car controlling the drivetrain, current systems have already learned many things about you.  In these particular cases, it probably returns searches more quickly or accurately based on things you typically search on or the car might accelerate a bit faster or slower based on how hard you hit the pedal.  These implementations of machine learning are already embedded in our everyday society and many of us probably don't even know it.  This is great and all, but those applications are very specific.  If you took the computer from a car engine and put it on a truck, or a boat or in a cell phone, it would be completely, maybe catastrophically, lost.</p>
  <p>Essentially, the "AI" we currently have is very specific.  Given a defined set of inputs (text, engine speed, etc.), it can return some very useful results.  However, the real "holy grail" of machine learning, IMO, is "Deep Learning".  Deep learning is being able to present a computer with a ton of very unrelated problems and having it not only make sense of them, but return viable answers.</p>
  <p>I find this fascinating!  What if one day we could create a system that could listen to what we said and did it?  If when we came home we had no light switches, doorknobs, thermostats... if everything was just controlled by voice (think Captain Kirk talking to the computer in Star Trek).  I think this problem is amazing because it could lead to a level of advancement in technology never before seen.  What if we gave this computer the hardest physics problems we could think of and came of with a number of answers.  Some of them might be horrendously wrong, but some might be viable and better than anything we could've ever thought of in our lifetimes.  Not because the computer is necessarily smarter than any individual person, but because it has access to all the world's information and could combine all those resources better than any human mind could.  I could go on, but this blog post might get a little lengthy lol.</p>
  <p>I also think that we're on the verge of breakthrough in this field.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng">Andrew Ng</a>, now at Baidu and formally at Google, is basically the lead researcher in the world in this field and some of his ideas and his innovations are awe inspiring (I'm also taking his online class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E">Introduction to Machine Learning from Stanford</a>).  I think machine learning is the next big thing in tech, and I would love to be even a small part of it.</p>

  <h1>Phase 0, Week 4</h1>
  <h4>Enumerable Methods</h4>
  <h5>March 1, 2015</h5>
  <p>This week was a bit more challenging that last week.  We learned about a pretty powerful type of method called "Enumerables".  We had used them before but I think this week was intended to give us a a lot of practice with them and see how we can use them best in our code.</p>
  <p>For me, the best part of enumerables was when it came to refactoring.  I have a little C++ background so I was using tons of if and while loops for my initial code when attacking the challenges.  My code worked, but it was gigantic.  When I started refactoring it was CRAZY how much smaller I could get my code to be using enumerables.  It was like a game.  I was combining them, nesting them, just trying to get the code to be as tiny as possible.  One line was the ultimate goal lol.  </p>
  <p>So basically an enumerable is a type of method that allows you to run through each element in the object you're calling the enumerable on.  If that sounds confusing, let me give you an example.  Say you have an array "x" that contains the numbers 1,2,3,4.

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">x = [1,2,3,4]</pre>

  Now say we'd like to get an array "y" that is each element of x multipled by 4:

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">y = [5,10,15,20]</pre>

  Instead of calling each individual element of x

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">y[0] = x[0]*1... y[1] = x[1]*1 etc...</pre>

  We can just call the enumerable "map" to create a new array that multplies each element of x by 4 and puts it into y like so:

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">y = x.map {|i| i*5}</pre>

  Done !!

  <p>Much easier than going through x element by element.  What the code is saying here in plain English is "using i as a place holder for the element you're currently on, go through each element of array x one by one, multiply it by 4, and create(map) this new resulting array (which has the same number of elements as x by the way) and put it in y".  I think I explained that as simply as possible, but I'm not sure.  Basically the enumerable "map" makes a new array exactly the same size as x but, using i as a placeholder for each element, does something to each element and puts it into a new array.</p>

   <p>These methods are great, I really enjoyed using them.  That's not news, though, because I LOVE CODING !! Enumerables are like another tool in the tool box that make my code better and better.  This week was sweet, just enough work to make it challenging but not enough to drive you mad lol.  I can't believe we're already on WEEK 5 !! ONWARD !

  <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
  <h4>Abstract Sequential</h4>
  <h5>February 22, 2015</h5>
  <p>I'm an abstract sequential thinker, whatever that means.  Supposedely, it means that I have to be very sure of myself when I make an argument so I research to the point of madness.  Anything less and I'm a constant skeptic, always wondering "But why?" I can work alone for hours at a time and, unfortunately, do not think out of the box.  I can say, objectively, that all of these characteristics are true in my case.</p>
  <p>DBC asked us to take the Gregorc Thinking Style questionaire, but I didn't really need a test.  I was well aware of these characterstics in myself.  I have good traits and bad when it comes to learning and working with others.  My need to be exactly right makes me research incessantly for even the most minor details.  I fell into a lot of black holes last week because of this.  I need to have more of a growth mind set.  I've mentioned this a lot since I've started DBC and I hope, in doing so, will make more more cognizant of the times that I may be falling into a black hole.  I need to realize that I'm learning a lot very quickly, and that if I don't get it all on the first try, that that's ok.  I already know a lot more than I knew yesterday, and that I can always come back to those things that are still giving me trouble.</p>
  <p>I also noticed that pairing does not really come naturally to me.  I work alone a lot, especially when it comes to coding, however, I'm so glad DBC puts such an emphasis on it.  I think I've grown and learned a lot in my pairing abilities.</p>
  <p>So I guess the moral here is that acknowledging your faults will hopefully make you more aware of them and, in turn, help you not fall into those bad situations as much.  I hope so, because I think time management will become valued more and more as we go on.</p>

  <h1>Phase 0, Week 3</h1>
  <h4>Arrays and Hashes</h4>
  <h5>February 22, 2015</h5>
  <p>This week was much easier than last week.  I actually saw a moderator on the Google hangout say that last week was probably the peak of the amount of work we will have in a week without being on site.  THANK GOD !!  I was seriously having doubts that I was going to be able to complete Phase 0 with any more weeks like that !  PHEW !!</p>
  <p>This week was our first stab at Ruby.  It was pretty simple, mostly because of the research we were asked to do for our application into DBC and, for me, because I've had experience in C++ programming.  Because of this, I found the challenges, for the most part, pretty straight-forward to get through.</p>
  <p>We learned about objects, methods, enumerables, arrays and hashes.  Arrays and hashes are very similar, they're kind of like lists.  Arrays are more like lists than hashes in that you access them by the order you put them in.  So by defining an array like this:

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">Names = ["Ari","Cindy","Paul"]</pre>

   to print Cindy to the screen is just

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">Names[2]</pre>

  Why not 3, you ask?  Well, confusingly (at least until you get used to it), the first index actually starts with 1, not 0.  So Names[0] is "Ari".  Get it?  Yea, once you get the syntax it's not too complicated.</p>
  <p>Hashes are slightly, yet significantly, different.  To me, they remind me of a sort of database.  Hashes can be indexed by anything, to call anything in the list.  In that way, it's not at all intuitive what the "order" is.  Actually, a lot of people call this an "unordered list" in that, because anything can call anything, there really is no order.  For example, if I associated the 3 names above with the ages 32, 27 and 31, (which is indexed like so):

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">Ages = {"Ari" => 32,"Cindy" => 27,"Paul" => 31]</pre>

   the question "Which of these comes first in the list?" is not readily identifiable.  You have to know which element in the hash you want information about to get it.  That element is called a "key".  As an example, you couldn't ask "What's the age of the second person on the list?", because there is no second person per se.  You have to ask "What's Cindy's age?"  Cindy is the key that we want more information about.  The way you ask this to Ruby is just like you would for an Array:

  <pre class="brush: ruby;">Ages["Cindy"]</pre>

   which would return 27.  So while you can't know exactly where anything is, you can make a much more meaningful list, and, you can gain a lot more meaningful information from this list by knowing the keys.</p>
   <p>Interesting stuff, huh?  Yea, I thought so ;o)
   </p>
   <p>Actually this stuff is really cool.  I'm already starting to see some of the power and potential of Ruby.  Can't wait for Week 4 !!

  <h1>Tough Week</h1>
  <h4>Blackholes everywhere</h4>
  <h5>February 17, 2015</h5>
  <p>This was a rough week.  They told us in the introduction to the challenge that this week would probably take much longer than usual.  Boy, they weren't kidding !! In our defense, we had only been through one week of challenges so the frame of reference was tiny.  But wow, just wow...</p>

  <p>They really packed a lot into this week.  The HTML stuff was pretty easy, but the CSS stuff was really getting to me sometimes and I was CONSTANTLY falling into black holes !!  I have to work on that, but there are 2 things that I just can't stand:</p>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Not completely understanding something</li>
      <li>Something not coming out exactly as I intended</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>These were happening all the time this week.  I probably spent a good 5 hours just in black holes (even though I had sufficiently completed the challenge).   I won't lie, the positioning stuff in CSS was really trial and error for me.  I just can't seem to understand it and nothing I've read (so far) really seems to be able to explain it in a way I can understand.  Then, even when an element was looking "kind of" how I wanted it to look, it was almost never perfect.</p>

  <p>I have to work on being ok with not knowing everything.  I learned a TON this week, but I came away feeling like a bit of a failure.  I definitely need to work on positioning and display commands in CSS, but I need to be able to accept that I did good work and learned a lot, and that THAT'S GOOD.  I know more today than I did yesterday.  If I can learn to accept this and move on it would probably help me a lot with falling into these black holes and wasting a ridiculous amount of time !!</p>

  <p>This week was rough, and at times had me a bit panicked.  Are all the weeks at DBC going to be like this?  I'm not even on-site yet !  Am I going to make it?  I typically deal with these feelings pretty well so I was able to overcome them and get the challenges done but man, it's so early in the program and I'm already panicking a bit :o/  Even so, the biggest feeling I have is excitement.  I love this sh*t !!  BRING ON WEEK 3 !!!</p>

  <h1>Phase 0, Week 2</h1>
  <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
  <h5>February 15, 2015</h5>
  <p> So this week we learned about HTML and CSS.  HTML is like the skeleton of web pages and CSS is like the really really nice clothes you can dress up your HTML with (that's actually a very good analogy).  So, after a while, you start to notice that HTML is pretty basic and CSS can get INSANELY complicated.
  </p>
  <p>So some of the most important items in CSS are classes and IDs.  Classes and IDs are way to change specific elements in your HTML based on a number of factors.  Best practice is to name an element to a class if it's a common element throughout the site (like a font-style for links).  That way it's easy to change all of the instances of those elements at one time.  ID's are for when you have a unique item on a page or on the site that needs to be changed uniquely (like an image).  Taking the dress up example, I kind of think of classes like a uniform for the masses while IDs are like couture for very special parts of your site.
  </p>
  <p> One of the biggest parts of CSS is controlling your margins, padding and borders.  Margin is the length from the outside borders of the web page to the border of the element.  Padding is the length between the contents of the element and the border.  The border is, essentially, between the passing and the margin.  Even now I don't know if I have that 100% but, of all the CSS I learned this week, I'm most solid on that.  Like 90%.
  </p>
  <p> The hardest part of CSS for me was figuring out how to display things.  You can display things inline or block or inline-block or you could float things or adjust positions absolutely or relatively.  Pretty sure displaying something inline displays things across instead of down, but then elements are allowed to overlap.  Inline-block is the same thing, except things aren't allowed to overlap, they end up underneath on the row directly below the element.  I think... UGH !!  I need to find every tutorial I can about these things because, honestly, it's kind of like trial and error right now figuring our how things end up on my site !!  SO FRUSTRATING !  Fell into so many rabbit holes this week doing this.
  </p>
  <p> Such a long week this week.  On to Week 3.

  <h1>Kitchen vs Table</h1>
  <h4>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h4>
  <h5>February 8, 2015</h5>
  <p>First, I'd like to admit I was very impressed by Shereef's honesty in his responses to the questions. He made it clear that DBC doesn't have all the answers, they're constantly changing the cirriculum, that employers are much more aware of development bootcamps in general, etc. Very refreshing.</p>

  <p>What I'll say about how we learn in DBC is that it's definitely very different from ANYTHING I've done before. It's really interesting. I was telling my girlfriend the other day that it feels like I'm learning in a class where everyone is talking about the material at the same time and helping each other out. Obviously, in a typical classroom environment this would be chaotic but with the Google+ hangouts and email and Twitter, it works really well. When I've had an issue I just go into the hangout and, a couple times, someone else in the cohort has already mentioned it and another person has already solved it !! Sick !</p>

  <p>I did find something that Shereef said I bit concerning, though. He said that those people who are introverts might have a bit more trouble than those who are extroverts, or at least that they might not get as much out of the program as extroverts. He did go on to say that they provide plenty of resources to address these issues and get you to be more engaging with the other students which was reassuring, but, alas, I am an introvert. On top of that, I know exactly what he's talking about since it's already readily apparent on the hangout ! Some students are always posting and contributing new things and helping out on the hangout, while others don't really talk at all. Part of the reason that I haven't contributed as much as others is because I feel I am a bit behind. I didn't really get to start on the Week 1 material until about Thursday and I was already starting to get emails from my accountability group (the last challenge in Week 1) ! So my goal from now on is to start AS SOON AS POSSIBLE on the coming weeks' challenges so that I can feel like I'm being more of an extrovert and contributing more to the hangout.</p>

  <p>Overall, I'm really excited about what I've seen and done so far and with what Shereef had to say. He really wants us to own this Bootcamp, to make it our own, to help each other and to ask questions. From what I've seen on the hangout this is definitely happening already and that's encouraging. Having people contribute so readily makes it easier for people like me who may not be as outgoing. Can't wait for Week 2 !!

  <h1>Phase 0, Week 1 at DBC</h1>
  <!--<h4>The subtitle, if you want it</h4>-->
  <h5>February 8, 2015</h5>
  <p>So, here we go; my journey to becoming a developer has officially begun !! This week has actually been pretty long. I don't know if I'm putting extra pressure on myself to understand everything as quickly as possible or if working a regular 9 to 5 with DBC is a little harder than I expected. Either way, I've gotten through it and I'm pretty satisfied with how well I know the material up to this point. We've learned about using command line, git, GitHub, version control and a bit about making websites and open source licenses.</p>

  <p>NO CODING YET !! I can see how this first week of DBC could be a bit frustrating for those who want to just dive into coding. We didn't learn anything about any languages this week. We learned, however, about the foundations of what are probably the best programming practices, especially for working in teams with other developers. We learned about GitHub, which is like a social network for developers. Well, not exactly but in many ways it is. You have different accounts and can follow other people on the site. But its mostly so we can save our code in the cloud for other people to see, and we communicate with it using git our local machines. We use git in Terminal to write different commands which commnicate to and from GitHub. Most of the communication we've learned so far is about cloning our GitHub repos to our local machines, making changes on our machines and sending (pushing) them back up to GitHub. Then on GitHub we can merge our changes with all the rest of our other code. This is all tracked through git and allows us to have a very descriptive running log of changes (or different versions) we've made since each time we "commit" a change, it's like a checkpoint that gets saved in git. I realize now how important version control is in the coding ecosystem, and it makes a lot of sense. When you're changing things in a long, complex web app or program, it's super helpful to have an idea of what changes were made, when, by whom if, all of a sudden, the project stops working correctly. I must admit, initially, I didn't understand why all the emphasis on making changes with git and all the practice doing so, but as I went along and got more comfortable it made a lot more sense. Besides the fact that if my computer craps out I have all my code in the GitHub cloud which is very reassuring :)</p>

  <p>Well, that's it for week 1. Honestly, I'm pooped but I will probably check out what's going on with next week's challenge and really look forward to the peer sessions and meeting my NYC cohort mates. Till next week !
