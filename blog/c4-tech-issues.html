  <h1>Issues in Tech</h1>
  <h4>Machine Learning</h4>
  <h5>March 1, 2015</h5>
  <p>So I've taken a huge interest in Machine Learning recently.  Some might call it an obsession lol.  Interestingly, a lot of the essential pre reqs needed to understand Machine Learning at a deep level are all classes I took in college.  So I've been on Khan Academy and MIT open courseware getting refreshers on Linear Algebra, Calculus and Stats.  Not like I need any more work to go along with DBC but it doesn't really feel like work.  Yea, I'm a nerd lol</p>
  <p>Machine Learning is a problem in tech right now for a few reasons.</p>
  <p>We know it can be really useful based on its current implementations.  From google searches to the computers in your car controlling the drivetrain, current systems have already learned many things about you.  In these particular cases, it probably returns searches more quickly or accurately based on things you typically search on or the car might accelerate a bit faster or slower based on how hard you hit the pedal.  These implementations of machine learning are already embedded in our everyday society and many of us probably don't even know it.  This is great and all, but those applications are very specific.  If you took the computer from a car engine and put it on a truck, or a boat or in a cell phone, it would be completely, maybe catastrophically, lost.</p>
  <p>Essentially, the "AI" we currently have is very specific.  Given a defined set of inputs (text, engine speed, etc.), it can return some very useful results.  However, the real "holy grail" of machine learning, IMO, is "Deep Learning".  Deep learning is being able to present a computer with a ton of very unrelated problems and having it not only make sense of them, but return viable answers.</p>
  <p>I find this fascinating!  What if one day we could create a system that could listen to what we said and did it?  If when we came home we had no light switches, doorknobs, thermostats... if everything was just controlled by voice (think Captain Kirk talking to the computer in Star Trek).  I think this problem is amazing because it could lead to a level of advancement in technology never before seen.  What if we gave this computer the hardest physics problems we could think of and came of with a number of answers.  Some of them might be horrendously wrong, but some might be viable and better than anything we could've ever thought of in our lifetimes.  Not because the computer is necessarily smarter than any individual person, but because it has access to all the world's information and could combine all those resources better than any human mind could.  I could go on, but this blog post might get a little lengthy lol.</p>
  <p>I also think that we're on the verge of breakthrough in this field.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng">Andrew Ng</a>, now at Baidu and formally at Google, is basically the lead researcher in the world in this field and some of his ideas and his innovations are awe inspiring (I'm also taking his online class <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzxYlbK2c7E">Introduction to Machine Learning from Stanford</a>).  I think machine learning is the next big thing in tech, and I would love to be even a small part of it.</p>
