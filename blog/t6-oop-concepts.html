        <h1>Phase 0, Week 6</h1>
        <h4>Object-Oriented vs Functional Programming</h4>
        <h5>March 15, 2015</h5>
          <p>Ruby, like many of the most popular programming languages out there, is an Object-Oriented language.  What this means is that any program is basically a collection of objects that are manipulated (and can manipulate each other) in such a way that a desired outcome is produced.  We can create all kinds of objects: classes, strings, arrays, hashes, etc. and we can do all kinds of things to these objects using methods, which can in turn involve other objects or methods.  These objects are named with variables which can be changed over and over again without issue.</p>
          <p>Functional Programming is very different.  It's very math based in that programs are made up of a series of functions which cannot be changed; this is known as being "immutable".  An example might be if you'd like to change the contents of an array.  Instead of just assigning new values to the array, you'd have to make a completely different array.  Also, functions have no memory in functional programming. This is known as being "stateless" and it means that they perform in exactly the same way each time they're run, with previous runs having no affect on future runs.  This is very different from object-oriented programming where methods and variables can change, and do change, all the time!</p>
          <p>Functional programming is some pretty advanced stuff but, as inflexible as it seems, it's very useful in situations where reliability is of the utmost importance.  Well, that begs the question, isn't reliability always important?  Yes, that's true but for this application it's important to take the context into account.  If your "Subway Surfers" game errors out and restarts when you are on the verge of a new high score, that would really suck, but would it be life changing?  I argue that life would go on.  However, if NASA needed a rocket to pinpoint the exact coordinates of an asteroid headed on a collision course with Earth and the code it uses must perform consistently and reliably every time, functional programming might be the the best way to go, don't you think?</p>
          <p>You know what?  I'm gonna look into this whole Functional Programming stuff a little more, sounds like there's a future in it !!
