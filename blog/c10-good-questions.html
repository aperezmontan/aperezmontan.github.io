  <h1>Good Questions</h1>
  <h3>And getting them answered...</h3>
  <h5>April 5, 2015</h5>
  <p>Dev Bootcamp on-site starts tomorrow.  I've been waiting for this day for a long time and it's finally here.  I'm really excited to get started but I think I'm handling it pretty well.  No nerves or anxiety... yet.  I don't REALLY know what to expect.  I mean they've given us a cirriculum and I've taken a tour, but what will it be like?  Will it be like the first day of high school or college?  I don't think so since we've paired with a bunch of folks in our cohort already so there's at least a modicum of familiarity there.  Will it be like the first day of work?  Doubtful since it really is a school and, at least for me, my work background was in retail and this is a tech space, so it will be a completely different vibe.  I know only a few things for sure: it will be hard, there will be breakfast (at least the first day), and I will have questions.</p>
  <p>Breakfast is awesome and I always knew Dev Bootcamp would be difficult, but one of the best ways to learn and to excel in all things is to ask good questions.  So what makes a question bad?  I always felt that a bad question is one that I don't know how to answer.  Let me distinguish that from not knowing the answer.  I don't know the answers to a lot of questions, that doesn't make them bad, because the answer is just "I don't know".  I think a question is bad when I think I may know the answer but the question is so poorly phrased that it makes me want to ask more questions.  Besides being annoying it makes it seem like the person asking the question may not have put much effort into finding the answer for themselves.</p>
  <p>For example, if someone asked me to back up their computer, I would have a TON of questions.  How much information do you have?  What kind of medium do you want me to back it up to?  Do you want to set up automatic backups?  What operating system do you have? Now if someone was a good friend or a family member, I might not mind asking all these questions since I wouldn't mind doing them the favor.  This is where one might need to take the audience into account.  On the web, you're typically asking questions of people who don't know you very well and, often, don't care that much whether you find the correct answer.  However, I don't think most people are against helping others, and, if the question is phrased precisely and you've shown an effort to try to solve it yourself, I think most people that recognize your situation would offer some sort of help. But if your question is too vague or generalized or you don't show any effort in trying to find the asnwer for yourself, I think most people would just keep scrolling.</p>
