        <h4>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h4>
        <h5>February 8, 2015</h5>
          <p>First, I'd like to admit I was very impressed by Shereef's honesty in his responses to the questions. He made it clear that DBC doesn't have all the answers, they're constantly changing the cirriculum, that employers are much more aware of development bootcamps in general, etc. Very refreshing.

What I'll say about how we learn in DBC is that it's definitely very different from ANYTHING I've done before. It's really interesting. I was telling my girlfriend the other day that it feels like I'm learning in a class where everyone is talking about the material at the same time and helping each other out. Obviously, in a typical classroom environment this would be chaotic but with the Google+ hangouts and email and Twitter, it works really well. When I've had an issue I just go into the hangout and, a couple times, someone else in the cohort has already mentioned it and another person has already solved it !! Sick !

I did find something that Shereef said I bit concerning, though. He said that those people who are introverts might have a bit more trouble than those who are extroverts, or at least that they might not get as much out of the program as extroverts. He did go on to say that they provide plenty of resources to address these issues and get you to be more engaging with the other students which was reassuring, but, alas, I am an introvert. On top of that, I know exactly what he's talking about since it's already readily apparent on the hangout ! Some students are always posting and contributing new things and helping out on the hangout, while others don't really talk at all. Part of the reason that I haven't contributed as much as others is because I feel I am a bit behind. I didn't really get to start on the Week 1 material until about Thursday and I was already starting to get emails from my accountability group (the last challenge in Week 1) ! So my goal from now on is to start AS SOON AS POSSIBLE on the coming weeks' challenges so that I can feel like I'm being more of an extrovert and contributing more to the hangout.

Overall, I'm really excited about what I've seen and done so far and with what Shereef had to say. He really wants us to own this Bootcamp, to make it our own, to help each other and to ask questions. From what I've seen on the hangout this is definitely happening already and that's encouraging. Having people contribute so readily makes it easier for people like me who may not be as outgoing. Can't wait for Week 2 !!

        <h1>Phase 0, Week 1 at DBC</h1>
        --<h4>The subtitle, if you want it</h4>
        <h5>February 8, 2015</h5>
          <p>So, here we go; my journey to becoming a developer has officially begun !! This week has actually been pretty long. I don't know if I'm putting extra pressure on myself to understand everything as quickly as possible or if working a regular 9 to 5 with DBC is a little harder than I expected. Either way, I've gotten through it and I'm pretty satisfied with how well I know the material up to this point. We've learned about using command line, git, GitHub, version control and a bit about making websites and open source licenses.

          NO CODING YET !! I can see how this first week of DBC could be a bit frustrating for those who want to just dive into coding. We didn't learn anything about any languages this week. We learned, however, about the foundations of what are probably the best programming practices, especially for working in teams with other developers. We learned about GitHub, which is like a social network for developers. Well, not exactly but in many ways it is. You have different accounts and can follow other people on the site. But its mostly so we can save our code in the cloud for other people to see, and we communicate with it using git our local machines. We use git in Terminal to write different commands which commnicate to and from GitHub. Most of the communication we've learned so far is about cloning our GitHub repos to our local machines, making changes on our machines and sending (pushing) them back up to GitHub. Then on GitHub we can merge our changes with all the rest of our other code. This is all tracked through git and allows us to have a very descriptive running log of changes (or different versions) we've made since each time we "commit" a change, it's like a checkpoint that gets saved in git. I realize now how important version control is in the coding ecosystem, and it makes a lot of sense. When you're changing things in a long, complex web app or program, it's super helpful to have an idea of what changes were made, when, by whom if, all of a sudden, the project stops working correctly. I must admit, initially, I didn't understand why all the emphasis on making changes with git and all the practice doing so, but as I went along and got more comfortable it made a lot more sense. Besides the fact that if my computer craps out I have all my code in the GitHub cloud which is very reassuring :)

          Well, that's it for week 1. Honestly, I'm pooped but I will probably check out what's going on with next week's challenge and really look forward to the peer sessions and meeting my NYC cohort mates. Till next week !
