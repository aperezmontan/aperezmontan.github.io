  <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
  <h5>March 15, 2015</h5>
  <p>I find this blog entry quite personal and particularly impactful in my life. I'll use this medium to somewhat purge myself of some feelings I've had for a long time now that, thankfully, I feel I may have found some answers to through research on this topic. I'll begin with a definition:</p>
  <p align="center"><font size="6"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat"><em>Stereotype Threat</em></a> is a situational predicament in which people are or feel themselves to be at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about their social group <small><i>- Wikipedia</i></small></font></p>
  <p>Dr. Claude Steele of Columbia University, is one of the leading researchers in this field. He explains that one of the first studies he performed was comparing the SAT scores of prospective students with their eventual performance at the university (coincidentally, the "university" here was the University of Michigan, where I graduated). He noticed that, intuitively, the higher a student scored on the SAT the better they performed while at the university. He noticed, however, while comparing white and black students, although they both showed the same correlation of better performance for better SATs, the performance of black students at the university was lower than for whites with the same SAT score. For example, a white student with a 1200 SAT score might become a B student at the university while a black student with a 1200 SAT score ended up becoming a C student. </p>
  <p>I wanted to give this context because I didn't do well at Michigan. I barely passed. It took me 4 and a half years to graduate and I was barely a C student. This is hard to write and I am somewhat embarrassed about putting it out there for all the world (including my potential future employers) to see... But I always wondered why? All my life I had been at the top of my class. My parents didn't have much money but they spent every spare dime they could to give me a world class education. I always went to private school, had mandatory reading lists and schoolwork (from my mom, who would eventually achieve her dream of becoming a schoolteacher. I like to tell people she practiced on me first :), countless tutors and the like. ANYTHING that would further my education, if my mom could make it happen, I was enrolled, signed up or scheduled.</p>
  <p>The hard work paid off, and I was accepted into the elite Stuyvesant High School in New York City. Here is where I think I had my first experience with Steretype Threat.  The demographics at Stuyvesant hit you like a ton of bricks when all the other schools you've ever been to were mostly white.  Everyone is Asian.  Not everyone, obviously, but I think the demographics were something like 65% from East Asia (including the Indian, Pakistani, Bengali, areas), 30% white and the remaining 5% black and hispanic.  There were so few black and hispanic minorities that in a school with over 3000 students I honestly think I was friends with all of them.  Quite a shock.  I didn't do poorly overall at Stuyvesant but I did initially. I was finding it hard to adapt to this new environment but eventually I got used to it and got As and Bs.  Not bad, but far from the straight A student I had been just a few years prior.</p>
  <p>Michigan was like a dream come true, that very quickly turned into a nightmare.  I worked hard my first term and ended up with Bs and Cs.  I was an engineering student so my classes were pretty rigorous and I assured my parents that I would do better.  I didn't.  With each successive term my grades got worse and worse until I was finally put on academic probabtion.  I stopped trying.  I never knew why.  The classes were hard, but they weren't impossible.  I learned a lot, even with the little work that I put in, but of course it wasn't enough.  I ended up changing majors, my dream of becoming an electrical engineer gone forever.  I was a bit upset about that but I remember thinking that not too many people like me even get this far.  I can still graduate with a degree from the University of Michigan!  Even if I barely make it, isn't that enough?</p>
  <p>I did slightly better in my last couple of years, but just enough to pass.  I never really tried as hard as I could.  I never really liked it at Michigan.  I felt like I was being looked at constantly and the stigma only emboldened me to further ostrocize myself.  Affirmative action was a hot topic at the time too. The supreme court decided that the affirmative action policies at Michigan were unconstitutional, making me feel even more like I didn't belong there.</p>
  <p><i>I wasn't good enough to be there... I keep getting bad grades... I'm a bad kid... I should just give up already.... GO HOME</i></p>
