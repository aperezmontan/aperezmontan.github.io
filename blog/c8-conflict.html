  <h1>Conflict</h1>
  <h3>Request Fatigue</h3>
  <h5>March 29, 2015</h5>
  <p>An ex girlfriend of mine used to give me "Request Fatigue".  Don't know what that is?  It's when someone asks you for so many things in a short amount of time that it literally has a fatiguing affect on you.  Obviously this is not a medical fact nor have I done any research into the condition but it's the best way I can describe what she used to do to me. To give you an example, say her and I were in the middle of watching a show.  Her requests would go something like this (I have listed the times to give you an idea of the frequency of her requests):</p>
  <ul><small>
    <li>  10:30: Could you get me some ice cream from the fridge?
    <li>  10:31: (after going to the kitchen and bringing her the ice cream) Since you're up could you get me my iPad from the other room?
    <li>  10:32: (while on my way back from getting her iPad) Did you take out the trash ? Something stinks.
    <li>  10:35: (after taking out the trash and right before attempting to sit back down) Oh, sorry, could you turn off the kitchen light, it's way too bright. Hurry up, the show's starting !
    <li>  10:36: (after sitting down and exhaling in relief) I'm sorry babe but could you get me the other ice cream, I don't like this flavor...
  </small></ul>
  <p>Man this would PISS ME OFF !  I felt like she was taking me for granted.  Like I was her little servant that she could ask to do anything and she knew I would do it.  It was like she wasn't taking my feelings into account, almost like it was all about her and it didn't matter how I felt. I don't know, I just feel like asking for things in that way is inconsiderate of the other person.  Like they're beneath you in a way.  Or maybe this is how all relationships are?</p>
  <p>At first I would tell her it pissed me off when she asked for things like that and we would end up fighting.  I realized later that me telling her that what she was doing "pissed me off" wasn't going to help the matter.  I needed to be specific and tell her how it made me feel.  I told her that I felt she was being inconsiderate by requesting things from me in such rapid fire fashion.  It was dehumanizing; that I felt less like her boyfriend and more like a servant.  She responded saying that she didn't realize that that's what she was doing.  To her at the time the requests just made sense and I could've said no or provided an alternative if I didn't want to do it at the time.  Also, some of her requests (like taking out the trash) were more like statements, not requests, in that she didn't specifically ask me to take out the trash, she was just noting that it smelled bad.  I didn't realize that, but, whether it was because it was in the middle of a "request stream" (another non-medical term made up by yours truly) or because I was trying to do my best to be a good boyfriend, I was carrying out tasks that she never explicitly requested.  She was just making a note.</p>
  <p>After that she would still give me request fatigue from time to time but it was much less frequent and she did notice it more.  I think we handled it as best we could and both learned to be more in tune with the other person's intentions.  But we broke up so it was probably a waste of time anyways...</p>
  <p>JUST KIDDING !!  One more week till onsite !<p>
