  <h1>Values</h1>
  <h3>Poise</h3>
  <h5>March 25, 2015</h5>
  <p>One of the values that I most admire is poise.  I know it may seem boring but it's something that I will try all my life to try to perfect, with varying degrees of success.  I admire poise because I think that's what a true leader exudes without trying.  From Winston Churchill to Derek Jeter, those men and women in history who seemed unflappable in this face of the greatest obstacles, they are my role models.  I think there's a lot to be said for a person who can stay focused when they get a bad break, someone who remains calm when getting some horrible news, a leader who calms his troops after a recent victory.  These individuals may seem boring, but to me they are the glue to an otherwise volatile society.  If the stock market is any indicator, we humans are an emotional lot.  We bask in emotion, in our ups and downs, and I believe it is the few who don't buckle under the pressure, who end up leading us forward.</p>
  <p>I've been described this way before.  Even though I feel like I can improve, I take a lot of pride being described as "even-keeled" or "cool under pressure".  I have my mother to credit for this.  I remember vividly one day at the swimming pool in our apartment complex in Virginia.  I had begged my mother to let me jump into the deep end of the pool, assuring her that I knew how to swim, that I wouldn't need any help.  At least I thought I didn't.  She relented and off I went, my legs pushed up against my chest and my arms wrapped around them as I lept, executing a textbook cannonball into the deep end of the pool.  And for a while, it was good.</p>
  <p>The moment was short-lived, however, as I quickly realized my self-professed aquatic acumen left much to be desired.  I was flapping my arms wildly (and ironically) like a fish out of water.  It was useless.  I ripped and clawed for the surface.  I gasped for air but I must've been thirsty because I had more than enough pool water to drink that day.  Every now and then, when I momentarily could get my head above the water, I noticed my mother coming towards me at a leisurely pace, unfazed, like nothing at all was wrong.  I could've sworn I saw my life flash before my eyes 3 times before she pulled me out of the water.  She didn't scold me, she asked me if I was ok.  I assured her I was and I went back to our spot poolside to get some air back in my lungs and to relax... for a bit.</p>
  <p>Almost like it never happened, I scurried over to the deep end and jumped in.  I had it this time !!</p>
  <p>No I didn't.  I was drowning again.  I was flailing my arms everywhere, gasping for air to no avail.  I tested fate twice and this time my mother wasn't coming for me.  I had been splashing and screaming for help for what felt like an eternity and my mother still wasn't here to help me.  I figured this was it, this was the end.  I was wrong.  My mom took a little longer, ensuring I downed a few more gulps of pool water this time, but she got me out.  No scolding, barely any words at all.  She just let me sit on the side and rest while she continued reading her magazine.  The pervading thought in my head was "why can't I get this?  Why can't I swim?  I thought I had it.  Didn't I?  Yes I did, I was sure of it !"</p>
  <p>I jumped back in...</p>
  <p>At this point I think the story becomes more believable if I told you that I stretched my arms out wide and pushed down hard and fast with my hands and feet and started doggy-paddling.  Nope, that's not what happened at all.  I was drowning again, and again, my mother, unperturbed, pulled me out of the pool.</p>
  <p>This time, the lifeguard came up to us and said "I'm sorry, ma'am, but you and your son are going to have to leave.  I can't watch the entire pool when your son is drowning every 5 minutes !"  So we left.  My mother never chastised me, she never punished me for my intolerable behavior.  We just picked up our stuff and we left.</p>
  <p>She was telling that story to a group of family and friends recently and someone asked her, "Please tell us, why on Earth did you let him keep jumping into the pool?!  And how could you be so calm about it??!" to which she replied,</p>
  <p>"I didn't want him to be afraid.</p>
  <p>"I was terrified at what was happening to him, but I knew if I ran up to him panicked and screaming his name that he may grow up forever being afraid of the water.  Kids look to you as their leader, their rock, and however you react to a situation, they're going to feel the exact same way."  She was 100% right.  I was afraid when I couldn't figure out how to come up out of the water for air, but to see her calmly pull me out told me instantly "there's nothing to be afraid of". It emboldened me.  It made me try harder to learn how to swim.  Focus in the face of adversity; resolve when things don't go your way; courage when you're afraid.  These are examples of poise, a value that I was taught when I was quite young, and that I'll never forget.</p>
