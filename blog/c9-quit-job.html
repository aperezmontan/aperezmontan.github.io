  <h1>Last day at Foot Locker</h1>
  <h3>Request Fatigue</h3>
  <h5>April 3, 2015</h5>
  <p>Today was my last day at Foot Locker.  My first job out of college and the only job I've ever known.  I'd been there almost 10 years.  It was strange.  There was like a strange aura around the day.  I had packed and removed most of my stuff from my desk the day before so I was sitting at an almost empty cube.  I was a little restless.  I wasn't emotional or sad, really, just anxious... perhaps waiting for that moment when the gravity of what I was undertaking would all hit me in the face.</p>
  <p>It never did though.  I said my goodbyes, there were hugs and hand shakes, but that was it.  Almost like everyone, including myself, knew that this phase of my life was over.  I basically grew up at Foot Locker, I learned a lot while I was there.  I guess there just wasn't much more to learn.  Overall I enjoyed my time there, and I loved the people, but it was time to move on.  I wish them all the very best.</p>
  <p>Farewell</p>
