        <h1>Phase 0, Week 2</h1>
        <h4>HTML and CSS</h4>
        <h5>February 15, 2015</h5>
          <p> So this week we learned about HTML and CSS.  HTML is like the skeleton of web pages and CSS is like the really really nice clothes you can dress up your HTML with (that's actually a very good analogy).  So, after a while, you start to notice that HTML is pretty basic and CSS can get INSANELY complicated.
          </p>
          <p>So some of the most important items in CSS are classes and IDs.  Classes and IDs are way to change specific elements in your HTML based on a number of factors.  Best practice is to name an element to a class if it's a common element throughout the site (like a font-style for links).  That way it's easy to change all of the instances of those elements at one time.  ID's are for when you have a unique item on a page or on the site that needs to be changed uniquely (like an image).  Taking the dress up example, I kind of think of classes like a uniform for the masses while IDs are like couture for very special parts of your site.
          </p>
          <p> One of the biggest parts of CSS is controlling your margins, padding and borders.  Margin is the length from the outside borders of the web page to the border of the element.  Padding is the length between the contents of the element and the border.  The border is, essentially, between the passing and the margin.  Even now I don't know if I have that 100% but, of all the CSS I learned this week, I'm most solid on that.  Like 90%.
          </p>
          <p> The hardest part of CSS for me was figuring out how to display things.  You can display things inline or block or inline-block or you could float things or adjust positions absolutely or relatively.  Pretty sure displaying something inline displays things across instead of down, but then elements are allowed to overlap.  Inline-block is the same thing, except things aren't allowed to overlap, they end up underneath on the row directly below the element.  I think... UGH !!  I need to find every tutorial I can about these things because, honestly, it's kind of like trial and error right now figuring our how things end up on my site !!  SO FRUSTRATING !  Fell into so many rabbit holes this week doing this.
          </p>
          <p> Such a long week this week.  On to Week 3.
