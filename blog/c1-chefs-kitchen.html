  <h2>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>
  <h4>February 8, 2015</h4>

    <p>
    First, I'd like to admit I was very impressed by Shereef's honesty in his responses to the questions.  He made it clear that DBC doesn't have all the answers, they're constantly changing the cirriculum, that employers are much more aware of development bootcamps in general, etc. Very refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
    What I'll say about how we learn in DBC is that it's definitely very different from ANYTHING I've done before.  It's really interesting.  I was telling my girlfriend the other day that it feels like I'm learning in a class where everyone is talking about the material at the same time and helping each other out.  Obviously, in a typical classroom environment this would be chaotic but with the Google+ hangouts and email and Twitter, it works really well.  When I've had an issue I just go into the hangout and, a couple times, someone else in the cohort has already mentioned it and another person has already solved it !! Sick !

    I did find something that Shereef said I bit concerning, though.  He said that those people who are introverts might have a bit more trouble than those who are extroverts, or at least that they might not get as much out of the program as extroverts.  He did go on to say that they provide plenty of resources to address these issues and get you to be more engaging with the other students which was reassuring, but, alas, I am an introvert.  On top of that, I know exactly what he's talking about since it's already readily apparent on the hangout !  Some students are always posting and contributing new things and helping out on the hangout, while others don't really talk at all.  Part of the reason that I haven't contributed as much as others is because I feel I am a bit behind.  I didn't really get to start on the Week 1 material until about Thursday and I was already starting to get emails from my accountability group (the last challenge in Week 1) ! So my goal from now on is to start AS SOON AS POSSIBLE on the coming weeks' challenges so that I can feel like I'm being more of an extrovert and contributing more to the hangout.

    Overall, I'm really excited about what I've seen and done so far and with what Shereef had to say.  He really wants us to own this Bootcamp, to make it our own, to help each other and to ask questions.  From what I've seen on the hangout this is definitely happening already and that's encouraging.  Having people contribute so readily makes it easier for people like me who may not be as outgoing.  Can't wait for Week 2 !!
