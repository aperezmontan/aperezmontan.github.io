  <h1>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h1>
  <h5>March 8, 2015</h5>
  <p>For this post we were asked to talk about giving and receiving feedback from our peers in DBC.  DBC requires we pair at least 3 times a week with someone in our cohort, puts a HUGE emphasis on feedback and encourages us to take it very seriously.  Since being at DBC, I've paired and given/received feedback over a dozen times at this point.  Here are some of the things I've noticed since I began. </p>
  <p>Pairing with someone you've never met can be pretty nerve racking.  I gotten used to it very quickly, however, and since we're always working on a challenge, to me, there's a direction for the conversation so long as you're both working to solve the problem.  Each encounter has been very smooth.</p>
  <p>All of my pairs have put 100% effort into solving the challenges we've worked on.  To that end I've found that many of them have gone out searching for different tips, tricks, plugins, etc. on their own that have made solving the problems, as well as using the different programs we need (sublime, terminal, github, etc.), so much easier.  Many of them post the help on our Google+ hangout so there's definitely a sense of team and "one for all" that permeates throughout the cohort which is really refreshing.</p>
  <p>One thing that can be frustrating about the pairing sessions is when someone you're working with doesn't strictly adhere to their "driver" and "navigator" roles.  In general a driver does the typing and the navigator does the talking.  It gets confusing for me because if the driver goes off on their own to search for a solution to a problem. I end up kind of feeling alone, like I'm not doing anything to contribute to the group.  Because of this, I go a little nuts (admittedly) about really defining the driver and navigator roles before we get into solving the challenge.  This way there's no confusion and I can also make it evident to my pair how important it is to stick to our roles.</p>
  <p>After we pair, we're required to give feedback on the session.  Reading your feedback can be a shocking experience to say the least.  I definitely learned some things that I may not have realized I had been doing during my session.  At first, I had a "get out of here" reaction.  I was incredulous.  But now that I've received similar feedback a few times, I think there are some things that I need to be a bit more cognizant of in my future pairing sessions.  For instance, sometimes I think I stay in my own head when trying to solve a problem instead of talking it out.  Some pairs have mentioned that talking it out and including them in my thought process could help us both solve the problem much easier.  I didn't even realize I was doing that !!</p>
  <p>Leaving feedback is the other side of the coin.  They encourage us to start out with something nice to say about our partner.  Then, give some sort of critique that they can improve on in the future.  Always make sure that your feedback is Specific, Actionable and Kind.  Being kind is easy, all of my pairs have been great, considerate and 100% devoted to solving the challenge.  Giving specific and actionable feedback though, not so much.  There are times that I feel that there's nothing my pair could've done better.  What do I say then?  I typically just say "keep doing what you're doing", but then my feedback gets rated (yep, our feedback gets anonomously rated by other DBCers) poorly.  UGH!
  <p>Overall I think the pairing and feedback process at DBC is great.  It has DEFINITELY accelerated the learning process for me while also familiarizing me with the typical work environment for a developer.  I honestly look forward to improving my pairing skills with the feedback I've been given because I know this is a skill that's required and probably not as well developed for most people looking to get jobs as developers.  Also, it has made me a more social person.  I'm an introvert by nature and I'm starting to realize that as a developer this isn't very helpful when working with others on a project.  Being forced to talk to people you don't know is one way of becoming more of an extrovert, and DBC demands, at least 3 times a week lol</p>
  <p>BRING ON WEEK 6 !!</p>
