        <h1>Phase 0, Week 3</h1>
        <h4>Arrays and Hashes</h4>
        <h5>February 22, 2015</h5>
          <p>This week was much easier than last week.  I actually saw a moderator on the Google hangout say that last week was probably the peak of the amount of work we will have in a week without being on site.  THANK GOD !!  I was seriously having doubts that I was going to be able to complete Phase 0 with any more weeks like that !  PHEW !!</p>
          <p>This week was our first stab at Ruby.  It was pretty simple, mostly because of the research we were asked to do for our application into DBC and, for me, because I've had experience in C++ programming.  Because of this, I found the challenges, for the most part, pretty straight-forward to get through.</p>
          <p>We learned about objects, methods, enumerables, arrays and hashes.  Arrays and hashes are very similar, they're kind of like lists.  Arrays are more like lists than hashes in that you access them by the order you put them in.  So by defining an array like this:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">Names = ["Ari","Cindy","Paul"]</pre>

           to print Cindy to the screen is just

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">Names[2]</pre>

          Why not 3, you ask?  Well, confusingly (at least until you get used to it), the first index actually starts with 1, not 0.  So Names[0] is "Ari".  Get it?  Yea, once you get the syntax it's not too complicated.</p>
          <p>Hashes are slightly, yet significantly, different.  To me, they remind me of a sort of database.  Hashes can be indexed by anything, to call anything in the list.  In that way, it's not at all intuitive what the "order" is.  Actually, a lot of people call this an "unordered list" in that, because anything can call anything, there really is no order.  For example, if I associated the 3 names above with the ages 32, 27 and 31, (which is indexed like so):

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">Ages = {"Ari" => 32,"Cindy" => 27,"Paul" => 31]</pre>

           the question "Which of these comes first in the list?" is not readily identifiable.  You have to know which element in the hash you want information about to get it.  That element is called a "key".  As an example, you couldn't ask "What's the age of the second person on the list?", because there is no second person per se.  You have to ask "What's Cindy's age?"  Cindy is the key that we want more information about.  The way you ask this to Ruby is just like you would for an Array:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">Ages["Cindy"]</pre>

           which would return 27.  So while you can't know exactly where anything is, you can make a much more meaningful list, and, you can gain a lot more meaningful information from this list by knowing the keys.</p>
           <p>Interesting stuff, huh?  Yea, I thought so ;o)
           </p>
           <p>Actually this stuff is really cool.  I'm already starting to see some of the power and potential of Ruby.  Can't wait for Week 4 !!
