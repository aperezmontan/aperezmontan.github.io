        <h1>Phase 0, Week 4</h1>
        <h4>Enumerable Methods</h4>
        <h5>March 1, 2015</h5>
          <p>This week was a bit more challenging that last week.  We learned about a pretty powerful type of method called "Enumerables".  We had used them before but I think this week was intended to give us a a lot of practice with them and see how we can use them best in our code.</p>
          <p>For me, the best part of enumerables was when it came to refactoring.  I have a little C++ background so I was using tons of if and while loops for my initial code when attacking the challenges.  My code worked, but it was gigantic.  When I started refactoring it was CRAZY how much smaller I could get my code to be using enumerables.  It was like a game.  I was combining them, nesting them, just trying to get the code to be as tiny as possible.  One line was the ultimate goal lol.  </p>
          <p>So basically an enumerable is a type of method that allows you to run through each element in the object you're calling the enumerable on.  If that sounds confusing, let me give you an example.  Say you have an array "x" that contains the numbers 1,2,3,4.

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">x = [1,2,3,4]</pre>

          Now say we'd like to get an array "y" that is each element of x multipled by 4:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">y = [5,10,15,20]</pre>

          Instead of calling each individual element of x

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">y[0] = x[0]*1... y[1] = x[1]*1 etc...</pre>

          We can just call the enumerable "map" to create a new array that multplies each element of x by 4 and puts it into y like so:

          <pre class="brush: ruby;">y = x.map {|i| i*5}</pre>

          Done !!

          <p>Much easier than going through x element by element.  What the code is saying here in plain English is "using i as a place holder for the element you're currently on, go through each element of array x one by one, multiply it by 4, and create(map) this new resulting array (which has the same number of elements as x by the way) and put it in y".  I think I explained that as simply as possible, but I'm not sure.  Basically the enumerable "map" makes a new array exactly the same size as x but, using i as a placeholder for each element, does something to each element and puts it into a new array.</p>

           <p>These methods are great, I really enjoyed using them.  That's not news, though, because I LOVE CODING !! Enumerables are like another tool in the tool box that make my code better and better.  This week was sweet, just enough work to make it challenging but not enough to drive you mad lol.  I can't believe we're already on WEEK 5 !! ONWARD !
