        <h1>Tough Week</h1>
        <h4>Blackholes everywhere</h4>
        <h5>February 17, 2015</h5>
          <p>This was a rough week.  They told us in the introduction to the challenge that this week would probably take much longer than usual.  Boy, they weren't kidding !! In our defense, we had only been through one week of challenges so the frame of reference was tiny.  But wow, just wow...</p>

          <p>They really packed a lot into this week.  The HTML stuff was pretty easy, but the CSS stuff was really getting to me sometimes and I was CONSTANTLY falling into black holes !!  I have to work on that, but there are 2 things that I just can't stand:</p>

          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>Not completely understanding something</li>
              <li>Something not coming out exactly as I intended</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

          <p>These were happening all the time this week.  I probably spent a good 5 hours just in black holes (even though I had sufficiently completed the challenge).   I won't lie, the positioning stuff in CSS was really trial and error for me.  I just can't seem to understand it and nothing I've read (so far) really seems to be able to explain it in a way I can understand.  Then, even when an element was looking "kind of" how I wanted it to look, it was almost never perfect.</p>

          <p>I have to work on being ok with not knowing everything.  I learned a TON this week, but I came away feeling like a bit of a failure.  I definitely need to work on positioning and display commands in CSS, but I need to be able to accept that I did good work and learned a lot, and that THAT'S GOOD.  I know more today than I did yesterday.  If I can learn to accept this and move on it would probably help me a lot with falling into these black holes and wasting a ridiculous amount of time !!</p>

          <p>This week was rough, and at times had me a bit panicked.  Are all the weeks at DBC going to be like this?  I'm not even on-site yet !  Am I going to make it?  I typically deal with these feelings pretty well so I was able to overcome them and get the challenges done but man, it's so early in the program and I'm already panicking a bit :o/  Even so, the biggest feeling I have is excitement.  I love this sh*t !!  BRING ON WEEK 3 !!!</p>
