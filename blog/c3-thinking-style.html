        <h1>Thinking Style</h1>
        <h4>Abstract Sequential</h4>
        <h5>February 22, 2015</h5>
        <p>I'm an abstract sequential thinker, whatever that means.  Supposedely, it means that I have to be very sure of myself when I make an argument so I research to the point of madness.  Anything less and I'm a constant skeptic, always wondering "But why?" I can work alone for hours at a time and, unfortunately, do not think out of the box.  I can say, objectively, that all of these characteristics are true in my case.</p>
        <p>DBC asked us to take the Gregorc Thinking Style questionaire, but I didn't really need a test.  I was well aware of these characterstics in myself.  I have good traits and bad when it comes to learning and working with others.  My need to be exactly right makes me research incessantly for even the most minor details.  I fell into a lot of black holes last week because of this.  I need to have more of a growth mind set.  I've mentioned this a lot since I've started DBC and I hope, in doing so, will make more more cognizant of the times that I may be falling into a black hole.  I need to realize that I'm learning a lot very quickly, and that if I don't get it all on the first try, that that's ok.  I already know a lot more than I knew yesterday, and that I can always come back to those things that are still giving me trouble.</p>
        <p>I also noticed that pairing does not really come naturally to me.  I work alone a lot, especially when it comes to coding, however, I'm so glad DBC puts such an emphasis on it.  I think I've grown and learned a lot in my pairing abilities.</p>
        <p>So I guess the moral here is that acknowledging your faults will hopefully make you more aware of them and, in turn, help you not fall into those bad situations as much.  I hope so, because I think time management will become valued more and more as we go on.</p>
