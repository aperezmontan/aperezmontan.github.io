        <h1>Phase 0, Week 8</h1>
        <h4>Issues in Tech: Cryptography, Cyber Security and Quantum Computing</h4>
        <h5>March 29, 2015</h5>
          <p>Security is important.  I think almost everyone wants to feel secure, to feel like their private things stay private.  This is especially true on the web where, likely, most people don't really know what happens to their private information once it gets punched into a computer and the send/submit/place order button is pressed.  For the most part we have faith in the Googles/Bank of Americas/Amazons out there; that they will keep our information secure.  If you feel this way, this entry might be encouraging or troubling.  Either way, I hope to shed a little light on what actually happens when you send your private information over the web.</p>
          <p>The way our "classical computers" (more on this in a later) keep our information secure is through encryption keys.  Using assymetric key encryption (where one key is public and one is private) people can send me information with the public key.  However, only I have the private key so only I can read the messages that are sent.  Let me qualify "only": I say "only" because, if an attacker wants to do enough decrypting work, they could potentially figure out my private key.  However, the amount of work required is so daunting that, on human time scales, I'm realistically the only one that has access the information.  This is because the public key is the product of prime numbers.  Finding the prime factors of a large number is exceedingly difficult for computers and almost impossible for humans.</p>
          <p>To give you an even simpler, more concrete example, think of your email address as a number that is the product of 2 primes: 9973 and 839.  The product, 8367347, is your email address.  You can publish 8367347 to the world and tell everyone to send you information to that address.  However, getting to that information in your mailbox requires you to factor 8367347 into it's component prime numbers, 9973 and 839.  Like I said above, factoring large numbers is tough (try it! try factoring 899 into it's primes.  The answer is at the end of this entry).  Conversely however, if you know one of these numbers, the answer is trivial, since you would just divide 8367347 by one of these numbers to get the other.</p>
          <p>Now, I said above that factoring a large number into its component primes is difficult for computers but it's not that difficult when the number is (relatively) small.  8367347 is small to a computer because a computer is capable of billions of computations or "trys" per second, so it could factor this number rather quickly.  But the keys we use in real life are significantly larger.  Ever heard of 64-bit encryption?  Think of each bit as a prime number and the key is the product of all these primes.  That number is in the quadrillions !!  When the number gets this big, as powerful as computers are, it takes decades of time to decipher these keys and becomes essentially impossible for humans.  That is, until viable quantum computers are created.</p>
          <p>Quantum computers have qubits instead of bits and, what makes them special and at the same time very difficult to understand, is that they can take on multiple values at the same time.  In "classical" computing, the computer has to try a value, see if it's correct, and, if not, try another value over and over again.  Quantum computers don't have this limitation.  Their qubits can simultaneously be any range of numbers, meaning that it can instantaneously calculate the 2 prime factors of any number with just 2 qubits.  128-bit encryption would be trivial to a quantum computer, factoring a number that would take a classical computer decades in a matter of seconds.</p>
          <p>Not to worry, however.  This problem is well-known and lots of research is going into new, more powerful encryption algorithms (noisy linear systems, lattice systems, etc.) that are difficult for all computers, quantum or not, to solve.  I think the importance of these techniques is intuitive for almost anyone.  When Target has the private information of all its debit card users compromised, that hits home.  Even if you haven't shopped at Target, it's natural to ask yourself "can other retailers that I've shopped at be subject to this kind of attack?"  While the attack that Target experienced is not the same thing that's discussed in this article, the lesson is well-received.  All forms of security can be compromised because we're human; security on the web is of the utmost importance; and we must continue to be vigilant and research to ensure we feel safe on this still new, virtual world.</p>
